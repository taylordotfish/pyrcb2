pyrcb2
======

Version 0.1.1

**pyrcb2** is an `asyncio`_-based library for writing IRC bots. It is designed
to be easy to use, customizable, and high-level.

pyrcb2 includes features such as account tracking, user prefix tracking (voice,
op, etc.), messaging delaying to prevent throttling, and long message
splitting.

pyrcb2 also makes use of `asyncio`_ and coroutines in Python. This allows you
to write asynchronous code in a linear fashionâ€”you can handle responses to
commands right after you send them.

.. code:: python

   # Wait until the bot has joined #channel.
   await bot.join("#channel")
   print("There are", len(bot.users["#channel"]), "users in #channel.")

   # Get user1's account.
   result = await bot.get_account("user1")
   if result.success:
       account = result.value or "(no account)"
       print("user1 is logged in as", account)
